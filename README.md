# Leaf Identification

The goal of the project is to design a classification model that is able to rec- ognize a specific plant species starting from some features that describe the characteristics of leafs in terms of shape and texture. The problem is known in literature as plant identification.
The aim is to compare different possible classification techniques, in the context of supervised learning, in order to provide a solution to the problem.
Several models have been designed and then compared in terms of estimated test error.
